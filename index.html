	<h1>Business Requirements Document for Dashboard 2.0</h1>
	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>This Business Requirements Document (BRD) details the framework necessary to evolve the Dashboard module from its
		current monolithic structure into a microarchitecture. This transformation will directly address several key
		business needs:</p>
	<h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
	<div class="inner-div">
		<p>Transform the Dashboard module into a microservice: The primary purpose is to extract the Dashboard module
			from
			the existing monolithic architecture and establish it as an independent, self-contained microservice. This
			aims
			to improve the Dashboard's modularity, scalability, and maintainability.</p>
	</div>
	<h3>1.2 Objectives:</h3>
	<div class="inner-div">
		<li>Enable live data display: Allow the Dashboard to receive and visualize data in real-time, ensuring users
			always
			have access to the most up-to-date information.</li>
		<li>Implement user configuration saving: Provide users with the ability to customize the layout and settings of
			their Dashboard and save these preferences for future use.</li>
		<li>Support custom queries: Empower users to execute custom queries against the underlying data, allowing them
			to
			extract specific insights tailored to their needs.</li>
		<li>Maximize uptime: Ensure the Dashboard remains operational with near-perfect availability (close to 100%
			uptime),
			minimizing downtime and service disruptions.</li>
		<li>Integrate AI capabilities: Introduce AI-powered features to the Dashboard, enabling automated insights
			generation and potentially conversational interactions with users (chat capabilities).</li>
	</div>
	<br>
	<h3>1.3 Scope:</h3>
	<h4>1.3.1 In Scope:</h4>
	<div class="inner-div">

		<h4>1.3.1.1. User Interface:</h4>
		<li>Design Consistency: Factory based component design for visual consistency and scalaility all across the
			dashboard.</li>
		<li>Intuitive Navigation: Design clear menus and workflows for ease of use.</li>

		<h4>1.3.1.2. Server:</h4>
		<li>Microservices Servers: Develop a NodeJS-based backend API layer consisting of the necessary
			microservices (Core Data, Analytics, Legacy Integration, etc.). Ensure secure communication with the
			frontend and
			manage database interactions.</li>
		<li>The Service Discovery mechanism helps us know where each instance is located. In this way, a Service
			Discovery component acts as a registry in which the addresses of all instances are tracked. </li>


		<h4>1.3.1.3. Connection Broker/Server:</h4>
		<li>Kafka Integration: Implementation of Kafka pipeline for data orchestration</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Kafka Topics: Design Kafka topics to organise data flow (e.g., separate topics for live updates,
				historical
				data transfers).</li>

			<li> Producers: Develop Kafka producers to publish data from existing systems into the pipeline.
			</li>

			<li>Consumers: Create Kafka consumers within the new dashboard's backend to receive updates and feed
				them into
				the database.</li>

		</ul>

		<h4>1.3.1.4. Database:</h4>

		<li>Schema Design: Optimise database structure for storing historical and time-series data for
			efficient queries.</li>

		<li> Query Optimisation: Develop queries for both static dashboard elements and real-time updates.
		</li>

		<li>TimeScaleDB Integration: Leverage TimeScaleDB's features for time-series data analysis and
			efficient
			real-time updates.</li>

		<h4>1.3.1.5. Data Migration:</h4>

		<li>Data Analysis: Assess what data needs to be migrated and in what format it currently exists.
		</li>
		<li>ETL Processes: Create extract, transform, and load (ETL) combining data from multiple sources
			into a large, central repository called a data warehouse processes to move data to the new,
			optimised database structure.</li>
		<li>Data Validation: Ensure data quality and consistency after migration</li>
	</div>
	<h4>1.3.2 Out of Scope:</h4>
	<div class="inner-div">
		<li>Immediate Replacement of the Legacy System: The project aims for a phased migration. The legacy dashboard
			will operate alongside the new dashboard during the transition.</li>
		<li>Complex AI Model Development: Assume the development of any sophisticated AI models is handled by a
			separate project or dedicated team. However, this project lays the groundwork for integrating and
			visualizing the outputs of these models.</li>
	</div>


	<h2>2. Functional Requirements:</h2>
	<div class="inner-div">
		<h3>2.1 Microservices:</h3>
		<li>The dashboard should be the initial phase of compartmentalization of backend</li>
		<h3>2.2 Data:</h3>
		<li>The Dashboard should support various data sources, including internal applications and external APIs. Data
			should
			be displayed in a clear and concise manner. The Dashboard should provide real-time
			updates and notifications.</li>
		<h3>2.3 Data Visualization:</h3>
		<li>The Dashboard should provide various data visualization options, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards. The
			visualizations should be interactive and allow users to drill down into specific data
			points.</li>
		<h3>2.4 Save Settings:</h3>
		<li>The Dashboard should have the capability to save the settings of the user of how the person arranged the
			dashboard</li>
		<h3>2.5 Custom Query:</h3>
		<li>The Dashboard should be able to put showcase result of custom queries</li>
	</div>

	<h2>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
	<div class="inner-div">
		<h3>3.1 Performance</h3>
		<li>The Dashboard should be highly responsive and performant. The Dashboard should be able to handle high
			volumes of
			concurrent users and data requests.</li>
		<h3>3.2 Scalability</h3>
		<li>The Dashboard should be scalable to accommodate growing user loads and data volumes. The Dashboard should be
			able
			to be easily scaled up or down as needed.</li>
		<h3>3.3 Reliability</h3>
		<li>The Dashboard should be intuitive but mainly reliable. The Dashboard should be available and operational
			99.9% of the
			time.</li>
		<h3>3.4 Maintainability</h3>
		<li>The Dashboard should be easy to maintain and update. The Dashboard should have a clear and concise codebase.
			The
			Dashboard should have well-documented APIs and processes.</li>

	</div>

	<h2>4. Technical Considerations</h2>
	<h3> 4.1 System Architecture</h3>
	<img src="./assets/sys-arc.png" class="centered-image" />

	<h3>4.2 Technology Stack</h3>
	<div class="inner-div">
		<li>Frontend: ReactJS - Continues handling the user interface.
		<li>Backend:
			<ol>
				<li>Microservices: NodeJS - We can utilize our existing Node Js functions and code</li>
				<li>Database: PostgreSQL - The core database for structured data.</li>
				<li>Time-series database: TimescaleDB - Efficiently stores and analyzes time-series data. Would be of
					great
					help for realtime data</li>
				<li>Message broker: Kafka - Enables asynchronous communication and event streaming between
					microservices.
				</li>
				<li>API Gateway interaction: Reduces complexity and speeds up app releases, client type
					Streamline and simplify request processing and policy enforcement by centralizing the point of
					control
					and offloading non-functional requirements to the infrastructure layer, Simplify troubleshooting
					with
					granular real-time and historical metrics and dashboards</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Machine Learning: Fine-tuned LLM with our data - analytics-focused LLM model for data analysis tasks within
			the
			microservices. <i class="suggestion">My suggestion for LLM: GPT-NeoX-20B because of its stats and maths data
				it has been trained on</i>
	</div>
	<h3>4.3 Monitoring and Instrumentation</h3>
	<li>The Dashboard should be monitored and instrumented to ensure a high performance and scalability. The
		monitoring
		tools should provide real-time insights into Dashboard performance.</li>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The Dashboard should be a critical component of the application. By implementing the requirements outlined in
		this document, we can improve Dashboard performance, scalability, and maintainability.</p>
